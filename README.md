This is an Android inventory keeping app which simulates the needs of a small bookstore.

This could easily be used as a small business inventory app for Android.  Currently, this is uses SQLite to keep records of ineventory.  There is an interface that allows you to add, create, delte or update items.  Items are directly viewable and can be ordered within the app.  This gives a link to the supplier site.  

For real world use: Although this app is ready for real world use, a few modifications could be made for the small business owner.  One of these could be to allow the app to connect to a central database.  Also, the allowance of direct order from a vendor rather than to just a website would be more useful.  Lastly, the design can be customized and tailored to the business, with small modification.

This project was written in JAVA in Android Studio.

This is the last project that I wrote for the Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity and completed the course under the Grow with Google scholarship.
